# CountryApp

**CountryApp** is a lightweight iOS application built with Swift. It displays a list of countries along with detailed information such as their name, region, and other attributes. The project showcases how to use `UIKit` with the `MVVM` architecture in a clean and scalable way. It also includes unit tests to ensure reliability and maintainability. The project also utilizes Swift Concurrency (async/await) to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently and adopts a protocol-oriented programming paradigm to improve flexibility and facilitate easier testing.
